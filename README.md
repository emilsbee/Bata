## Batavierenrace mobile application

This application is meant to be a general purpose app for the participants of the [Batavierenrace](http://batavierenrace.nl/). Specifically, for gettings updates regarding the race, asking questions to volunteers as well as inspecting the routes. I wrote this app as an assignment for university. Below each feature of the app is mentioned and a short demo can be viewed. Also, the APK file of this application can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RC0dWO4OkR4glpHNOnT0QHIX06ISoKG9?usp=sharing). Unfortunately, IOS version is not available. In login use username emils@gmail.com and password 123456.

### Login system

The application has a simple login system whereby each participant receives login information that they can use to login to the app during the race. When the race is over, login information becomes invalid. The login as well as the whole backend is implemented using [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

### Route inspection

Batavierenrace is a multi stage race so it is important where one participant finishes and next one starts, hence the users of this app can inspect each stage of the whole run. It is possible to have overview of all stages, as well as inspect individual stages and see additional information about them, like who runs that stage and how long it is. Below is a short demo of this feature.

### Chat with volunteers

The app includes a simulation of a chat with a volunteer. It is a simulation because the answers given in the chat are hard coded. The purpose of the chat is for participants to be able to quickly reach out to volunteers to find out information about the race. Below is a short demo of this feature.

### Bata bottle: a fun water reminder

This is an extra feature for novice runners that sends a notification reminded to drink some water. The duration after which a notification is sent is calculated using height and weight provided by the user. Below is a short demo showing the feature.
